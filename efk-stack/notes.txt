- The capabilities and applications of the ELK stack are limited only by your imagination :)
- default elasticsearch port: 5601


AWS CNI Plugin
- Responsible for network connectivity of containers and removing allocated resources when the
container is deleted.
- Responsible for setting up pods' network
- The AWS-provided VPC CNI is the default networking add-on for EKS clusters.
- VPC CNI add-on is installed by default when you provision EKS clusters.
- The VPC CNI add-on consists of the CNI binary and the IP Address Management (ipamd) plugin:
The CNI assigns an IP address from the VPC network to a Pod.
- The ipamd manages AWS Elastic Networking Interfaces (ENIs) to each Kubernetes node and maintains the warm pool of IPs.

EKS Worker Nodes
- The nodes communicate with the control-plane through the cluster public endpoint.
- To register a node, kubelet contacts the Kubernetes cluster endpoint: the kubelet also
receives API instructions and provides status updates and heartbeats to the endpoint on a regular basis.
- As the nodes start, the EKS bootstrap script is executed and Kubernetes node configuration
files are installed.
- As part of the node boot process, the container runtime agents, kubelet and Kubernetes node
agents are installed.

EKS Control Plane Communication
- Can happens in two ways:
1. private endpoint communication.
2. public endpoint communication.

Egress vs Ingress
- Ingress --> The traffic that originates from somewhere else and reaches your Worker nodes.
- Egress --> The traffic that originates from the nodes and leaves the network.
- Nodes with public or elastic IP addresses within a subnet are configured with an internet gateway
to allow ingress traffic from outside of the VPC.
- Private subnets usually include a NAT gateway, which only allows ingress traffic to the nodes from
within the VPC while still allowing traffic from the nodes to leave the VPC (Egress)
- For nodes running in private subnet:
1. The Egress resources eg load balancers have to be in a public subnet.
2. The nodes then run in a private subnet.
3. Ingress Node traffic will enter via the NAT gateway or the ENI.

Ipv4 vs Ipv6
- In the IPv6 world, every address is internet routable. The IPv6 addresses associated with the nodes and pods are public.
Private subnets are supported by implementing an egress-only internet gateways (EIGW) in a VPC, allowing outbound traffic while blocking all incoming traffic.

Amazon VPC Lattice
- Used to consistently and securely connect services across multiple VPCs and accounts
(without requiring additional connectivity to be provided by services like VPC peering, AWS PrivateLink or AWS Transit Gateway)
